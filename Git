Need to learn few commands in git

git clone repostory link

git status

git add .

git commit -m "message for commit"

git push -u origin master

finally updated code will refelct from bash to git hub


git checkout child(feature branch)

above command used to move another branch. It helps not to distrub main branch

You can do any changes it wont reflect in main

Once you have done the changes have to commit your changes.

git commit -m "messgae"

If you want to pull your chnages directly to main branch 

git push -u origin child branch:main branch


To check for conflict


otherway to merge:

git checkout main branch

git merge child branch

git to check conflicts
